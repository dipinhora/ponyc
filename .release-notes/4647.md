## Make sure systematic testing doesn't switch to suspended thread

Previously, the systematic testing next thread logic would consider switching to the pinned actor thread even if it was suspended. This was very wasteful since the suspended pinned actor thread would not do any meaningful work and almost immediately re-suspend itself.

We have changed things so that the next thread logic properly takes into account whether the pinned actor thread is suspended or not when selecting the next thread to activate.
